## 💡 Reflection

This project taught me the following:
1. How to use the JavaScript video API for custom player controls.
2. The importance of responsive design and cross-browser compatibility.
3. Debugging common issues like timeline scrubbing and caption toggles.

Although some parts were challenging (e.g., syncing the progress bar and time display), I feel this was an excellent learning experience and a solid foundation for building interactive media components.

## ⚡ Challenge Yourself!

Try extending this project:
- Add a "loop" button to replay the video indefinitely.
- Implement a dark/light theme toggle for the video player.
- Fetch video data dynamically using a JSON file.
